# Building Projects with Native Code

Follow these instructions if you need to build native code in your project. For example, if you are integrating React Native into an existing application, or if you "ejected" from Create React Native App, you'll need this section.



The instructions are a bit different depending on your development operating system, and whether you want to start developing for iOS or Android. If you want to develop for both iOS and Android, that's fine - you just have to pick one to start with, since the setup is a bit different.
