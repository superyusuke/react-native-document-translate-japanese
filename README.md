React Native  
Learn once, write anywhere: Build mobile apps with React  
Get StartedLearn the Basics  
Build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React  
React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.

import React, { Component } from 'react';  
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

```js
class WhyReactNativeIsSoGreat extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>
          If you like React on the web, you'll like React Native.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          You just use native components like 'View' and 'Text',
          instead of web components like 'div' and 'span'.
        </Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

A React Native app is a real mobile app  
With React Native, you don't build a “mobile web app”, an “HTML5 app”, or a “hybrid app”. You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Image, ScrollView, Text } from 'react-native';

class AwkwardScrollingImageWithText extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ScrollView>
        <Image
          source={{uri: 'https://i.chzbgr.com/full/7345954048/h7E2C65F9/'}}
          style={{width: 320, height:180}}
        />
        <Text>
          On iOS, a React Native ScrollView uses a native UIScrollView.
          On Android, it uses a native ScrollView.

          On iOS, a React Native Image uses a native UIImageView.
          On Android, it uses a native ImageView.

          React Native wraps the fundamental native components, giving you
          the performance of a native app, plus the clean design of React.
        </Text>
      </ScrollView>
    );
  }
}
```

Don't waste time recompiling  
React Native lets you build your app faster. Instead of recompiling, you can reload your app instantly. With Hot Reloading, you can even run new code while retaining your application state. Give it a try - it's a magical experience.

Use native code when you need to  
React Native combines smoothly with components written in Objective-C, Java, or Swift. It's simple to drop down to native code if you need to optimize a few aspects of your application. It's also easy to build part of your app in React Native, and part of your app using native code directly - that's how the Facebook app works.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { TheGreatestComponentInTheWorld } from './your-native-code';

class SomethingFast extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <TheGreatestComponentInTheWorld />
        <Text>
          TheGreatestComponentInTheWorld could use native Objective-C,
          Java, or Swift - the product development process is the same.
        </Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
